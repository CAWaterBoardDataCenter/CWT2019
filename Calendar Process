Information was pulled from the original pdf calendar with titles and links copied into an excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was structured with event titles in the first column, the start date in the second column, the end date in the third or fourth column, and the event link in the fifth column. If the event lasted more than one day I would color code the the two date boxes a non-white color.
Once entered into the excel sheet I initiated a new calendar in the SWAMP google account titled "Clean Water Team 2019". 
I entered all events in order of date. If the event was a month long or longer I would put the event title only on the first day of the month. If the event lasts one week or less I would set the event to display through the duration of the dates stated. 
I color coded each type of event to differentiate among the others. If the event is a single day I would code it as a light blue. If the event was a week long event I coded it as a light green. If the event was a month long I coded it as a dark green. If the event was a multi-day conference I coded it as a dark blue. If the event is a year long event (i.e. Year of the Periodic Table) I coded it as a maroon color.
If the event was determined to repeat on the same day every year then I coded the event to repeat annually on that exact date. If the event did not repeat I left it alone in google and made a note in the excel spreadsheet that it would need to be updated the following years.
